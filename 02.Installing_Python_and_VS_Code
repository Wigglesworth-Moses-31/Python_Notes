### 🎥 **What’s This Video About?**
This video walks you through the process of **installing two key tools** for learning Python:
1. **Python Interpreter** – This is what actually runs your Python code.
2. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – This is the code editor (IDE) where you'll write and manage your Python programs.

### 🐍 **Step 1: Installing Python**

#### ✅ What is Python?
- Python is the programming language you’re going to use.
- To write and run Python code on your computer, you need to install the **Python interpreter**.

#### 🔽 How to Install It:
1. Go to [python.org](https://python.org) and search for "Download Python".
2. Click the link to download the latest version (e.g., Python 3.13.1).
   > 🔁 *Don’t worry if the version number is different — just get the latest one.*

3. Once it’s downloaded, **run the installer**.

#### ⚙️ Important Installation Settings:
- **Check both boxes** on the installer screen:
  - One of them is usually “Add Python to PATH” — very important!
  - The other might be to install Python for all users.
- Click **Install** and give it permission if it asks for admin access.

🎉 After a few moments, Python is installed!

### 💻 **Step 2: Verifying Python Installation**

1. **Right-click** on the desktop or start menu and open **Terminal** (or **Command Prompt**).
2. Type `python` and press **Enter**.
3. If Python is installed correctly, it will show something like:
   ```
   Python 3.13.1
   >>>
   ```
   ✅ This means everything is working perfectly!

### 🧑‍💻 **Step 3: Installing VS Code**

#### 💡 What is VS Code?
- VS Code is a **free code editor** developed by Microsoft.
- It makes writing code easier and more organized.
- Millions of developers use it!

#### 🔽 How to Install It:
1. Google **“Download VS Code”** and go to the official [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Download the version for your OS (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and:
   - **Accept the agreement**
   - Click **Next** several times
   - **Check the boxes** just like in the video (especially the ones that integrate VS Code into your system)
4. Click **Install**, wait for it to finish, and then click **Finish**.

🎉 VS Code is now installed and ready to go!
