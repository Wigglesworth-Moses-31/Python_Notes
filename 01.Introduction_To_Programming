### 🎉 Welcome to Python Programming

The speaker, Harry, welcomes you to the course and thanks you for joining. He’ll be your guide throughout the course and has lots of experience teaching people how to code — millions of students, actually! He’s excited to share all the useful things he’s learned over the years.

### 🧠 What You’ll Learn in This Video

In this part of the course, you're going to learn:

- What a **programming language** is
- Why learning **Python** specifically is important

---

### 💻 What is a Programming Language?

Think of it like this:

- We humans use languages like English, Hindi, or Spanish to talk to each other.
- Computers don’t understand those — they have their **own languages**, called **programming languages**.

So if you want a computer to do something for you, you need to “speak its language” — and that’s what programming is.

---

### 🧾 Rules of Programming — "Syntax"

Every language has rules — for example, grammar in English or Spanish.

Similarly, programming languages also have rules, and these are called **syntax**.

- If you don’t follow these rules, the computer won’t understand your instructions.
- When something goes wrong because of bad syntax, the computer gives an **error**.

So, just like you wouldn’t write "am I fine you" in English, you shouldn’t write code that doesn’t follow the syntax of a programming language.

### 🧩 What is Programming?

Programming is the act of:
- Solving problems using code.
- Turning your ideas into instructions that a computer can follow.

For example, making a calculator, building a website, or even creating a game — that’s all done using programming!

### 🐍 Why Python?

Python is the language you'll be learning in this course. Why Python?

- **Simple and beginner-friendly:** Great for those who are just starting out.
- **Readable:** The code looks almost like English.
- **Popular:** Used by people of all skill levels — from newbies to expert developers.
- **Powerful:** It’s used in exciting fields like **data science**, **AI**, and **machine learning**.
- **Versatile:** You can build websites, automate tasks, analyze data, create games, and much more.

So if Python is your first programming language — awesome choice! 🎉

### 📦 What’s Next?

In the next lesson, you’ll install:
- **Python**, the language itself.
- An **IDE** (which is a special tool that helps you write and run code more easily).
