### 🧰 1. **Getting VS Code Ready for Python**
VS Code is a powerful code editor (IDE), but it needs a little setup for Python development.

#### ✅ What you do:
- **Open VS Code**
- You’ll see a clean interface. Don’t worry if it feels overwhelming — it gets easier.
- **Create a folder** called `Python Course` (optional, just for organization).
- Inside it, create another folder: `01_setup`.

---

### 🧱 2. **Understanding the VS Code Interface**
Here are some key parts of VS Code you should know:

- **Explorer (top icon on the left)**: Shows all files in your project.
- **Search**: Lets you find text in your files.
- **Source Control**: For version control (skip for now).
- **Run and Debug**: For running and debugging code (we’ll use it later).
- **Extensions (last icon)**: This is where the magic begins.

---

### 🧩 3. **Installing Python Extensions**
Now let’s make VS Code Python-friendly.

#### ✅ What you do:
- Click on **Extensions icon**
- Search for **Python**
- Install the one from **Microsoft** (with the blue tick).
  - It includes both the **Python extension** and **Python Debugger**.

---

### 📂 4. **Open a Folder in VS Code**
VS Code works best when you open a folder as your "workspace."

#### ✅ What you do:
- Click **File → Open Folder**
- Choose the `01_setup` folder inside your `Python Course`
- It’ll ask if you trust the folder → Click **Yes**

Now your folder is visible in the Explorer.

---

### ✨ 5. **Customize Appearance (Optional)**
Want your editor to look cool? Change the **theme**!

#### ✅ What you do:
- Click **⚙️ (gear icon bottom-left) → Color Theme**
- Try out built-in themes or install new ones like:
  - **Jellyfish** (funky!)
  - **GitHub Theme** (professional and clean)

Use arrow keys to preview themes before selecting.

---

### 📝 6. **Create Your First Python File**
Let’s get to the good stuff — coding!

#### ✅ What you do:
- In Explorer, click the **new file icon** ➕
- Name it: `main.py`  
- `.py` means it's a Python file

---

### 🧪 7. **Write and Save Some Code**
Type this into `main.py`:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

#### ✅ What you do:
- Press `Ctrl + S` to **save**
- A small dot in the tab means unsaved; it disappears when saved.

---

### ▶️ 8. **Run Your Code**
Look for a small **Run** button or open the terminal and type:

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll see:

```
Hello World
```

Boom! You just wrote your **first Python program** 🎉

---

### 🔄 9. **File Sync with VS Code**
VS Code keeps your files in sync:
- Any file created/deleted inside VS Code appears in your folder
- Any file added from File Explorer shows up in VS Code too

Try creating a `.txt` file like `hello.txt` and see it in both places.

---

### 🧙 10. **Some Cool Settings**
Optional but useful:

#### 🔍 Zoom in/out
- `Ctrl + +` to zoom in
- `Ctrl + -` to zoom out

#### 🔁 Auto Save
- Go to **File → Auto Save**
- Now you don’t need to press `Ctrl + S` every time!

#### 🧑‍🏫 Screencast Mode
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` → Type “Screencast Mode”
- This shows your keypresses on screen (great for tutorials)

#### 🔎 Quick File Search
- Use the top search bar to find files quickly by name

---

You have now:
1. Set up VS Code
2. Installed the Python extension
3. Created a folder + Python file
4. Written and run your first Python program!
5. Customized your coding environment
